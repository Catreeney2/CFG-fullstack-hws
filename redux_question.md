## Redux question

### Part 1

1. This code shows a Redux reducer managing a state 'value'. 
If the action 'increment' is triggered the reducer increases 'value' by 1. 
Regardless of increase or not, it returns the current state. 

2. Adding a second action with type 'decrement' following the same pattern
as increment. it would return:  
``value: state.value - 1``
3. A third action is added with type 'reset' that returns the state to 
initialState with:   
`` return initialState ``


### Part 2

##### 1. 
On line 34 the function uses useState to create a varaible called studentsCount and
give it a state, initially of 0. It also creates a function setStudentsCount
to update the variable.   

On line 39 a button is created with an associated onClick event handler.
{????} is a placeholder for what will happen when the button is clicked. 
A function should be declared elsewhere in the code that is called when 
the button is clicked, presumably an addStudent function.
